<h4>Preface:</h4>
<h6>People normally eat three meals at breakfast, lunch and dinner, but for many reasons,<br>
    some people may eat more or less than this number, for example people with poor stomachs<br>
    often eat many meals to avoid burden. Heavy digestion helps with better food tolerance.<br>
    Eating is highly object oriented, which means it depends on your physical condition and activity level.<br>

    both quality and quantity. Like all other behaviors, eating takes a way.</h6>
